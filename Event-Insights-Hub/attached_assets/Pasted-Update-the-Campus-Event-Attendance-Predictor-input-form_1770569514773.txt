Update the Campus Event Attendance Predictor input form so that all features used by the trained ML model and present in the SQLite database are captured via UI inputs.
The goal is 100% schema alignment between dashboard input → backend pipeline → trained model.

Required Input Sections & Fields
1️⃣ Event Metadata (Categorical Inputs)

Use dropdowns with fixed options only.

Domain

Tech

Law

Design

Music

Business

Event Type

Workshop

Guest_Lecture

Career_Talk

Speaker Type

Industry

Faculty

Alumni

Day Type

Weekday

Weekend

Time Slot

Morning

Afternoon

Evening

2️⃣ Event Configuration (Numerical + Boolean)

Duration (Hours)

Numeric input (float)

Range: 0.5 – 5.0

Promotion Days Before Event

Numeric input (integer)

Range: 0 – 30

Certificate Provided

Toggle or radio

Values:

Yes → 1

No → 0

Interactivity Level

Slider

Range: 0.0 – 1.0

Step: 0.05

3️⃣ Engagement Friction Inputs (Critical – Must Add)

Add a dedicated section titled: “Student Engagement Frictions”

Each friction should be a slider or dropdown with values 1 to 5, where:

1 = Low friction

5 = High friction

Promotion Friction

How ineffective promotion is perceived

Fatigue Friction

Student burnout or overload

Format Friction

Event format not appealing

Social Friction

Peer influence or lack of social pull

Schedule Friction

Timing conflicts with classes/exams

Relevance Friction

Event not aligned with student interests

These must map internally to:

Promotion_Friction_1 … Promotion_Friction_5

Fatigue_Friction_1 … Fatigue_Friction_5

Format_Friction_1 … Format_Friction_5

Social_Friction_1 … Social_Friction_5

Schedule_Friction_1 … Schedule_Friction_5

Relevance_Friction_1 … Relevance_Friction_5

(one-hot encoded by the backend pipeline)

4️⃣ Prediction Output Section

After submission, display:

Predicted Expected Attendance (large numeric card)

Attendance Category

Low / Medium / High

Confidence Interval (± range)

Visual Gauge or Bar Indicator

5️⃣ Intelligent Recommendations Panel

Based on input + prediction, dynamically show actionable suggestions, for example:

“Increase promotion days to improve turnout.”

“High schedule friction detected — consider changing time slot.”

“Interactivity is low compared to high-attendance events.”

“Industry speakers historically perform better for this domain.”

6️⃣ Backend Integration Rules (Do NOT Break)

UI sends raw categorical + numeric values only

Dashboard must load:

artifacts/latest_model.joblib


No encoding or scaling in frontend

Prediction request must match training schema exactly

Optional toggle:

“Save prediction to database”

7️⃣ UX Expectations

Group inputs logically (Event Info / Engagement / Frictions)

Tooltips explaining each friction

No free-text fields

Validation on every input

Clean, professional, minimal UI
